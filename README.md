**Pros**

- clear separation of product lines/companies. A one solution/style/script for all product lines will likely fall apart.

**Cons**

- no top-level "one for all" scripts like `npm i` (but that's also an appeal. a one solution/style/script for all product lines will likely fall apart eventually)
- manual workspace definition of other product line dependencies is required
